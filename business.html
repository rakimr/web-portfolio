<center><h2 style="color:white"><p>International Business Research üîé</p><BR> 
My International Marketing professor asked me to choose a country I thought an American brand would do well in.<BR>
I chose Petsmart as the brand and Australia as the country and to my surprise there wasn't a lot of data to work with.<BR>
But with enough research I was able to conjure up decent reasoning as to why Petsmart would succeed in Australia.<BR>
For this project, I used google sheets and python as tools to help me get my point across.<BR>
I will give a full breakdown of how I used these tools, then afterwards link the research paper.<BR>
If you'd like, you can skip straight to the research paper linked at the end of the page.<BR></h2></center>

<h3 style="color:white">Petsmart_Products<BR></h3>
<h4 style="color:white">On the Petsmart_Products sheet, I used kaggle.com to find and download a Petsmart retail product dataset in the form of a csv file.<BR>
I then inserted that file onto the sheet, cleaned the dataset, and created the column "Animal Type."<BR> 
The "Animal Type" column was created using functions <mark>=SPLIT(text, delimiter, [split_by_each], [remove_empty_text])</mark>, to seperate the contents that make up the "Item Description" values, and <mark>=FIND(search_for, text_to_search, [starting_at])</mark> to find the key animal names among the split values.<BR>
These formulas arent on display, due to having to copy and paste as values in order to filter them.<BR>
The pie chart you see here will be featured in the research report.<BR></h4>


<h3 style="color:white">Aussie_Ownership<BR></h3>
<h4 style="color:white">On the Aussie_Ownership sheet, there is pet ownership data being sourced from a national australian survey held by Newgate Research.<BR>
This data was extracted using the Get Data from PDF macro on Excel, then pasted into this sheet.<BR>
I was then able to create a bar chart, reflecting the data.<BR>
This bar chart will be featured in the research report.</h4>

<h3 style="color:white">Pet_Expenses<BR></h3>
<h4 style="color:white">On the Pet_Expenses sheet, I am sourcing data from the same PDF file as the Aussie_Ownership sheet is sourcing from.<BR>
This data consists of the annual expenses of Australian pet owners by category.<BR>
To understand it a bit easier, I've created a bar chart for this data table as well.<BR>
The bar chart will be seen in the research report.</h4>


<h3 style="color:white">Correlation<BR></h3>
<h4 style="color:white">On the Correlation sheet, there is data that is being sourced from the World Happiness Report.<BR>
I downloaded the data right from their website worldhappiness.report. It consists of each countries Happiness score, filled with categorical data that is believed to be what constitutes happiness.<BR> 
I was able to find the significant and positive correlation between Social Support and Happiness by creating a scatter plot using both of those variables' respective columns.<BR>
This chart will be seen in the research report.</h4>

<h3 style="color:white">Research Report<BR></h3>

<h4 style="color:white">All of the data I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized in the Petsmart Australia workbook was organized and put together to create the Research Report you see below.<BR>
The slides are here for you to have a more visual experience when reading the report.<BR>
I feature PetBarn locations, which would theoretically be Petsmart's competitor.<BR>
Also in slides 7 and 8, I feature a couple of lines of python code used to create bar charts from a South Australian Dog Owner dataset sourced from kaggle.com<BR>
The first line of python code <mark>df.groupby("Region")["Animal_Type"].value_counts().sort_values().plot("bar")</mark> computes a bar chart for the top regions of Australia with dog owners.<BR> 
The second line of python code <mark>df.groupby("Suburb")["Animal_Type"].value_counts().sort_values().tail().plot("bar")</mark> dives a tad deeper computing a bar chart for the top suburbs of Australia with dog owners.<BR>
Of course, this can all be found in the report below.<BR></h4>
